# Bard add-on for Statamic 3 for adding a span and class to selected content

![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0+-FF269E?style=for-the-badge&link=https://statamic.com)

This is an example Bard addon for Statamic 3 that adds a span with a class to selected content. In this example, you can
select from a number of Les Mills group fitness classes.

While this has a personal purpose for my own use, it also shows a simple working example of how to wrap selected content
with an element, and add a class. Something that does have many use cases beyond something as trivial as this example.

## Installation

Install it via the composer command

```
composer require martyfriedel/les-mills-class-types
```

In your Bard editor instances (note, *not* the configuration view), you'll see the new button added.

## License

## Les Mils

Les Mills are an awesome company based on New Zealand, who make the best group fitness classes in the world, including
BODYPUMP - I've been trained in 5 of their programs, and teaching Les Mills group fitness classes for over 14 years.
Their "L" letter has been used for the button for this plugin purely for demonstration purposes.
